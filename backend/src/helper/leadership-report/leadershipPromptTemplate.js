https://youtu.be/Hwn_W-X2Rds?si=4GZBTtObEzX1Azx_ - Marshall Goldsmith outlines a structured approach to coaching aimed at facilitating behavioral change. He emphasizes the importance of identifying specific behaviors to change, involving stakeholders for feedback, and following up to ensure progress. The process is iterative and focuses on measurable outcomes.

https://youtu.be/BlVZiZob37I?si=PoUJxVlwiDHFVha9 - In this video, Goldsmith introduces the concept of "feedforward," which involves giving suggestions for future improvement rather than focusing on past mistakes. This approach encourages positive change and is often more effective than traditional feedback methods

https://youtu.be/FYhws73vm0c?si=MKjNn7EMHTBRT0EF - Goldsmith presents a six-question framework designed to enhance communication between leaders and their teams. The questions focus on goals, progress, and how leaders can support their team members, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.


https://youtu.be/2owIN1RooDo?si=CICLUEONsdP1FGtK - This video discusses the negative impact of the word "but" in conversations. Goldsmith explains how it can negate positive statements and suggests using "and" instead to maintain a constructive dialogue.



https://youtu.be/UxjR_a9c-qE?si=vuuSHnXU8EEdwcCV - Goldsmith explores how seemingly harmless comments can be destructive in a professional setting. He provides insights into recognizing and avoiding such comments to foster a more positive work environment.

https://youtu.be/qsxLbx8GTj4?si=nm24dX4HJVHoVWPY - In "Teaching Leaders What to Stop: Making Destructive Comments," Marshall Goldsmith warns that sarcastic, cutting remarks—often dismissed as harmless or candid—can deeply damage relationships and team morale. These comments usually serve to assert superiority, not to add value. The twist: most people don’t even realize they’re making them. Since self-awareness is limited, listening to others’ feedback is crucial. Goldsmith offers a simple test: if a comment doesn’t help the customer, company, or the person involved, don’t say it. True leadership requires restraint, not just honesty.

https://youtu.be/0-VSOII2t1g?si=z2M9RSl6AqBdfU9G - In "Teaching Leaders What to Stop: Aren’t I Smart and Aren’t They Stupid?" Marshall Goldsmith exposes a common leadership flaw: the compulsion to prove intelligence by elevating oneself or putting others down. He reveals that 65% of communication is wasted on self-praise or belittling others—offering no learning or value. The antidote? Stop engaging in or tolerating these ego-driven habits. Leaders who resist the urge to showcase superiority, especially when it's unnecessary, reclaim time, boost productivity, and pave the way for genuine growth.

https://youtu.be/sXibuyCKXdw?si=353imgH8TfYjuZmn - in "Teaching Leaders What to Stop", Marshall Goldsmith emphasizes that effective leadership isn't just about adopting new behaviors but also about eliminating detrimental ones. He identifies common habits—such as the need to always win, adding unnecessary value, making destructive comments, and showcasing one's intelligence at others' expense—that can hinder team dynamics and personal growth. Goldsmith advocates for self-awareness and restraint, urging leaders to pause and consider the impact of their words and actions. By consciously stopping these negative behaviors, leaders can foster a more positive, collaborative, and productive work environment.

https://youtu.be/JVDkFU-M65Q?si=GP13CfbzwaWtw_ZL - n "Winning Too Much," Marshall Goldsmith highlights the most pervasive and challenging leadership habit to break: the constant need to win—at everything, all the time. Whether the issue is big or trivial, professional or personal, many leaders instinctively push to be right or come out ahead. This compulsive need undermines collaboration, damages relationships, and limits growth. Goldsmith illustrates through relatable case studies how resisting the urge to “win” in conversations or conflicts leads to stronger connections and better outcomes. His advice: pause, reflect, and ask—“Is this really worth winning?” Letting go can be a true leadership strength.
